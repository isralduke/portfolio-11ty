### About the Client

Natchez, Mississippi celebrated its tricentennial birthday with several days of [The Natchez Half marathons](https://thenatchezhalf.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=7774) and fun runs in November 2016. The Natchez Half marathons were produced and managed by The Slow Polks, a marathon production agency.

### Design Inspiration

The feathers are chosen as symbols of freedom, movement, and beauty. Three feathers represent three hundred years of life. The colors represent fall and water as the marathon was held in the fall next to the river which runs alongside the city.
