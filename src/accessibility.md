## Accessibility is Required

I believe that accessibility is legal requirement, a human right, and an important way to serve more clients. Because it’s the right thing, accessibility thing should be shifted left in projects’ planning, design, and development.

## Personal Committment

As a designer, I committed personal time, effort, and even money to pursuing greater amounts of accessibility-related knowledge. I have taken Sara Soueidan’s [Practical Accessibility course](https://practical-accessibility.today/), enrolled in the [DHS Truster Tester certification course](https://www.dhs.gov/trusted-tester), and a few other courses in my [Credentials section](#certifications). Because I have frontend skills too, I can engage with actual frontend developers with more impact on compliance and project timelines.

## What It Means

I am sure many stakeholders will wonder how many of their customers need these accomodations. In truth, it’s a lot of [potential customers and users](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/datasets.html). So if we consider how information is encoded in HTML, the sequence of information, how it’s operated in technology, and how it’s visually presented, it means **I put extra work on myself** to meet organizational goals and user needs.

## Known Issues

The lightbox I am using needs to be replaced. It doesn’t yet trap focus when the modal opens but it does close when the escape key is pressed. It’s not an obstruction yet, but it’s an annoyance, I know.
