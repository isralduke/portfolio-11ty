## Project Goal

Create a brand new  budget mobile app to help people create and stick to a budget. The app will put all aspects of their budgets just a few taps away.

## Target Audience

The primary audience is young adults and young professionals who have never used a budget before. The secondary audience is young adults who have tried budget apps but found them too complex.

## Research & Key Challenges

I used Google Docs questionnaires to remote interviews for a wide range of ages. While [user journaling or diary studies](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/) aren’t as robust as other forms of research, it was the only way I could get the initial research done with my timeline and participants’ schedules.

The key challenges were to limit the features to just those features which will educate first-time budgeters about budget concepts. The participants said that the budget app they tried were too complex so I kept the feature set limited.

## Initial Design Concepts &  Wireframes

First I drew many hand sketches to capture my initial design ideas, using the [Crazy 8s method](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase3-sketch/crazy-8s). The best ideas from my initial design concepts were translated into digital wireframes in Figma.

## Usability Testing

Participants reviewed the digital wireframes and answered questions about navigation and asked further questions about budget concepts. Their feedback became usability testing data and recorded in a spreadsheet for each participants. The responses were transformed into affinity groups to find themes.

## Conclusion

The budget app design’s is neutral. I decided not to make it “fun” or “serious” because the apps tried by my participants fell into one or the other style and it didn’t help them. The app has a light and day mode which don’t conform to either “white” or “black” themes. I wanted the themes to be warm and approachable to offset the app’s neutrality.
