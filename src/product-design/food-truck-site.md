## Project Goal

Create a responsive website so customers know when the food truck is in their area and place their order ahead of time.

## Target Audience

BzzTruck’s audience is primarily onsite employees and workers in the cities where it has a presence. These are mostly office workers in a variety of sectors.

## Research & Key Challenges

During remote interviews I uncovered popular food trucks in the regions where the participants lived. These participants also gave me information in the usability studies remotely, via teleconferencing and screen sharing, to create user journeys.

The key challenge was to condense the client’s expectations and market-standard features into a simple website.

## Initial Design Concepts & Wireframes

The wireframes were created alongside the users’ input. Their interviews became the basis for decisions made in the digital wireframes.

## Usability Testing

Usability testing data was recorded in a spreadsheet for each of the participants. The responses were transformed into affinity groups to find themes.

## Conclusion

Depending on BzzTruck’s business success, a mobile application will designed which will feature notifications in conjunction with order ahead and proximity sensing.
