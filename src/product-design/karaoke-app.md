goal : The goal was to deliver an app design which met specified contest theme criteria in three hours.

targetAudience : 
research : No research was done for this app. We had three hours to concept an app, design it, and present it. Given our time constraints, we used <strong>Lean UX</strong> and <strong>Genius Design</strong> while keeping user-centric principles in mind.
keyChallenges : The app doesn’t require logins or accounts as it uses the bar’s wifi connection to communicate with other users of the same app on the local network. The app’s “disposable” nature precludes the need to create logins or save user information. (This results in an easier experience for patrons with less than their full cognitive capacity.) The apps work in conjunction to synchronize all aspects of the competition such as voting, queueing entrants, and loading songs.

conclusion : The team designing this app, “The Pun-o-matics,” of which I was a part with Michael Alford, won 1st Place People’s Choice and 2nd Place Professionals’ Choice awards. The app isn’t actually built but I’d love to collaborate with interested parties in actually building it. It was conceived and designed at Adobe Creative Jam, New Orleans.

### User & Audience

The audience for the karaoke compeition app, called “Let’s Duet Again” are bar patrons who want to compete as teams of two against other patrons. Oh, it’s not uncommon for these users to experience temporary use challenges, such as **decreased cognitive capacities**.

### Key Challenges

The app doesn’t require logins or accounts as it uses the bar’s wifi connection to communicate with other users of the same app on the local network. The app’s “disposable” nature precludes the need to create logins or save user information. (This results in an easier experience for patrons with less than their full cognitive capacity.) The apps work in conjunction to synchronize all aspects of the competition such as voting, queueing entrants, and loading songs.

### Research

No research was done for this app. We had three hours to concept an app, design it, and present it. Given our time constraints, we used **Lean UX** and **Genius Design** while keeping **user-centric principles** in mind — the users would be cognitively burdened.
