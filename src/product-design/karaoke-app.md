## Project Goal

My team had to plan and design an app which met specified contest theme criteria in three hours. The contest theme was ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Do It Again‚Äù so we decided to submit an app for karaoke duets. The target audience could be the contest judges (_this was for a contest_) or the imaginary users.

## Target Audience

The audience for the karaoke compeition app, called ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Duet Again‚Äù are bar patrons who want to compete as teams of two against other patrons. Oh, it‚Äôs not uncommon for these users to experience temporary challenges, such as **decreased cognitive capacities**. (_I‚Äôll let you guess why._)

## Research & Key Challenges

No research was done for this app. We had three hours to concept an app, design it, and present it. Given our time constraints, we used **Lean UX** and **Genius Design** while keeping **user-centric principles** in mind ‚Äî the users would be cognitively burdened.

The app doesn‚Äôt require logins or accounts. It will use local device wifi and bluetooth connection to communicate with other users.

## Initial Design Concepts & Wireframes

Hand sketches were created after ad hoc audience interviews. Wireframes were skipped due to the contest time limit.

## Usability Testing

Ad hoc interviews with audience members were carried out to determine potential problems users might encounter in a real life situation.

The app wouldn‚Äôt require logins or accounts as it uses the bar‚Äôs wifi connection to communicate with other users of the same app on the local network. The app‚Äôs ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù nature would preclude the need to create logins or save user information. (_This results in an easier experience for patrons with less than their full cognitive capacity. Most of us can‚Äôt even remember our passwords when we‚Äôre not challenged._) The app works in conjunction to synchronize all aspects of the competition such as voting, queueing entrants, and loading songs in a local, _ad hoc_ network.

## Conclusion

The team designing this app, ‚ÄúThe Pun-o-matics,‚Äù of which I was a part with [Michael Alford](https://www.michaelalford.com/), won 1st Place People‚Äôs Choice and 2nd Place Professionals‚Äô Choice awards. The app isn‚Äôt actually built but I‚Äôd love to collaborate with interested parties in actually building it. It was conceived and designed at [Adobe Creative Jam, New Orleans](https://www.behance.net/gallery/66242371/New-Orleans-Creative-Jam-2018).
