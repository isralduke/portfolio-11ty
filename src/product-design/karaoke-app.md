## Project Goal

My team had to plan and design an app which met specified contest theme criteria in three hours. The contest theme was “Let’s Do It Again” so we decided to submit an app for karaoke duets. The target audience could be the contest judges (<em>this was for a contest</em>) or the imaginary users.

## Target Audience

The audience for the karaoke compeition app, called “Let’s Duet Again” are bar patrons who want to compete as teams of two against other patrons. Oh, it’s not uncommon for these users to experience temporary challenges, such as <strong>decreased cognitive capacities</strong>. (<em>>I’ll let you guess why.</em>)

## Research & Key Challenges

No research was done for this app. We had three hours to concept an app, design it, and present it. Given our time constraints, we used <strong>>Lean UX</strong> and <strong>>Genius Design</strong> while keeping <strong>>user-centric principles</strong> in mind — because the users would be cognitively burdened. The app doesn’t require logins or accounts. It will use local device wifi and bluetooth connection to communicate with other users.

## Initial Design Concepts & Wireframes

Hand sketches were created after ad hoc audience interviews. Wireframes were skipped due to the contest time limit.
