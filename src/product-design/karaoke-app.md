featureAlt : iPhones showing the screen designs for the karaoke competiton app.
roles      : ['UI Designer','üåü Star Performer']
goal : The goal was to deliver an app design which met specified contest theme criteria in three hours.
targetAudience : The target audience could be the contest judges (this was for a contest) or the imaginary users. Let‚Äôs make it for the imaginary users. They‚Äôll be somewhat cognitively burdened though, so this has to be simple.
research : No research was done for this app. We had three hours to concept an app, design it, and present it. Given our time constraints, we used Lean UX and Genius Design while keeping user-centric principles in mind.
keyChallenges : The app doesn‚Äôt require logins or accounts. It will use local device wifi and bluetooth connection to communicate with other users of the same app. The app‚Äôs ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù nature precludes the need to create logins or save user information.
sketchText : Sketches were created after ad hoc audience interviews.
wireframeText : Wireframes were skipped due to the contest time limit.
usabilityText : Ad hoc interviews with audience members were carried out to determine potential problems users might encounter in a real life situation.
conclusion : The team designing this app, ‚ÄúThe Pun-o-matics,‚Äù of which I was a part with Michael Alford, won 1st Place People‚Äôs Choice and 2nd Place Professionals‚Äô Choice awards. The app isn‚Äôt actually built but I‚Äôd love to collaborate with interested parties in actually building it. It was conceived and designed at Adobe Creative Jam, New Orleans.

### User & Audience

The audience for the karaoke compeition app, called ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Duet Again‚Äù are bar patrons who want to compete as teams of two against other patrons. Oh, it‚Äôs not uncommon for these users to experience temporary use challenges, such as **decreased cognitive capacities**.

### Key Challenges

The app doesn‚Äôt require logins or accounts as it uses the bar‚Äôs wifi connection to communicate with other users of the same app on the local network. The app‚Äôs ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù nature precludes the need to create logins or save user information. (This results in an easier experience for patrons with less than their full cognitive capacity.) The apps work in conjunction to synchronize all aspects of the competition such as voting, queueing entrants, and loading songs.

### Research

No research was done for this app. We had three hours to concept an app, design it, and present it. Given our time constraints, we used **Lean UX** and **Genius Design** while keeping **user-centric principles** in mind ‚Äî the users would be cognitively burdened.
