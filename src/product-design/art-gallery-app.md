### Project Goal

During the art gallery mobile application design process I acted as the UX Designer and User Researcher. The goal was to create a new mobile experience for the gallery. The app helps visitors buy tickets in the app, shows them upcoming gallery events, and helps them plan their visit to the gallery.

### Target Audience

The target audience is composed of two primary segments. The first segment is made up retired, senior visitors who often rely on third parties for transportation to the gallery. They need accommodation and accessibility information for their visits. The second segment is made up of young professionals who can visit the gallery in the evenings and weekends. The second segment is most likely to buy tickets in the application. Both segments expressed a desire to attend weekend events at the gallery.

### Key Challenges

The key challenges in the process was arranging for the in-person usability studies for the seniors who make up the first segment of the target audience. Segment two was comfortable with video interviews.

### Research

The research began with online surveys to determine the content in the mobile application which users most likely expect. Participants were chosen from people who normally visit art galleries and art museums. The seniors who represent the second segment of the target audience participated in in-person usability studies. I conducted remote interviews with participants who represented the second segment of the target audience.

### Initial Design Concepts

Paper sketches were used to capture initial design ideas, using crazy 8 methodology.

### Digital Wireframes

The best ideas from initial design concepts were translated into digital wireframes.

### Usability Testing

Usability testing data was recorded in a spreadsheet for each of the participants. Each participant was asked to perform key tasks in the wireframes. Moderated, remote testing enabled us to answer questions about the function about the wireframe setup verses the actual wireframe design. Testing occurred with digital wireframes with some follow up in the mockups.

### Conclusion

For the next steps I want to design an Apple Watch app to go along so that visitors can scan their tickets on their wrists. This would make it easier for seniors who use Apple Watches to enter the building using walkers or other assistive instruments.
