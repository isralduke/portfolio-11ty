mockups    : ['mockup-1.png','mockup-2.png','mockup-3.png','mockup-4.png']
roles      : ['User Researcher','UX Designer','UI Designer']
goal : The goal was to design a note-taking app which appeals to casual note takers. The app would note present overly-structure note interfaces.
personas   : ['persona-1.jpg','persona-2.jpg']
targetAudience : The target audience for the sketch note app is someone who likes to use their finger to draw quick sketch notes. They don’t necessarily want to abandon the features of a digital note, but they’re not interested in a structured note.
research : Research was performed by interviewing people who liked using real life sticky notes. We asked them why they liked sticky notes and what they would add to digital versions of sticky notes.
keyChallenges : The key challenge was repeatedly resisting our own efforts at “gold plating” — adding unrequested features. Keeping features to bare minimum resulted in a simpler user experience and a less cluttered user interface.
sketchText : We started with real pencil and paper to immerse ourselves in the organic feel we wanted to preserve for the user. Squares are the shape of sticky notes and squares are simple, basic shapes, so we decided to stick to simple shapes for the user interface and icons as well.
wireframes : 
usabilityText : We asked friends and family to look at Sketch mockups, sized for their phones, to get their feedback. We took that feedback to inform further iterative work on the app.
conclusion : A second version is currently in planning and design. We don’t have a release date yet.

### Overview

Squiddle is a free, note-creating iOS app inspired by sticky notes. Squiddle notes have a square format, just like physical sticky notes. The user interface isn’t hidden but the “power user” gets features like tagging and alarms.

### Target Audience

The user for Squiddle likes to scribble notes because they’re easier to make and it feels more natural than starting a text editing experience. The act of scribbling a note is a natural, more organic experience.

### Initial Design Concepts

We started with real pencil and paper to immerse ourselves in the organic feel we wanted to preserve for the user. Squares are the shape of sticky notes and squares are simple, basic shapes, so we decided to stick to simple shapes for the user interface and icons as well.

### Conclusion

A second version is currently in planning and design. We don’t have a release date yet.
