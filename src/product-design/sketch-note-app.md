## Project Goal

The goal was to design a note-taking app which appeals to casual note takers.

## Target Audience

The target audience for the sketch note app is someone who likes to use their finger to draw quick sketch notes. They’re not interested in a structured note. The act of scribbling a note is a natural, more organic experience than a text-editing experience.

## Research & Key Challenges

Research was performed by interviewing people who liked using real life sticky notes. The key challenge was repeatedly resisting our own efforts at “gold plating”.

## Initial Design Concepts & Wireframes

We started with real pencil and paper to immerse ourselves in the organic feel we wanted to preserve for the user. Squares are the shape of sticky notes and squares are simple, basic shapes, so we decided to stick to simple shapes for the user interface and icons as well.

## Usability Testing

 We asked friends and family to look at Sketch mockups, sized for their phones, to get their feedback. We took that feedback to inform further iterative work on the app.

# Conclusion

While the first version of the app is in the App Store, we are currently working to make the second version more robust and friendly.
