featureAlt : App screen designs for the event guide app.
mockups    : 
  - iPhone showing the screen for reading presentation session details.
  - iPhone showing the screen for browsing through the presentation session groups.
  - iPhone showing the screen for browsing through bookmarked sessions.
  - iPhone showing the launch screen.
roles      : ['UX Designer','UI Designer']
goal : The goal for the product is to enable conference attendees to make a plan to attend as many presentations as possible.
targetAudience : The audience for SQL Saturday Guidebook are developers, database administrators, and other information technology workers such as designers, projects managers, business analysts, and other I.T. employees. Dark mode was chosen for the theme from an ad-hoc survey of would-be attendees. Many developers seem to prefer the dark mode of Visual Studio. A light mode is planned to be incorporated as a choice for subsequent years.
research : Research was conducted using past years’ attendees’ feedback surveys. Features were generated from insights gathered from the surveys.
keyChallenges : The app is designed to be easily developed using Xamarin and many pre-defined layouts within Xamarin. Using pre-defined layouts enabled us to produce the app more quickly for both iOS and Android phones. Additionally, the design for the app had to be complete within a week. We relied on Lean UX and Genius Design in lieu of user research.
personas : 
  - Persona card for William who represents back end developers and users who care about the data model of the app.
  - Persona card for Gwenly who represents designers and the information organization within the app.
initialConcept : The initial design concepts were sketched on the fly in one of the initial planning meetings for the event. Using an ad hoc competitive analysis of other event guide apps, the event advisory board — myself included — generated the requirements on the spot. Given the short turn-around time, digital wireframes were skipped.
initialConcepts : 
  - Digital hand sketch of the home screen and bookmarked sessions screen.
  - Digital hand sketch of the session details screen and the session categories screen.
usabilityText : Usability was taken from the limitations and the considerations discussed by the executive. These items were influenced by the timeline and technical constraints of the project.
usabilities: 
  - Feature constraints captured from an executive team member.
  - Technical constraints captured from several executive team members.
conclusion : As dark modes are all the rage among developer IDEs, I designed the app with dark mode only (which helped my short turn around time). For the next year I will add a light mode to the app. The annual event is including more management types, so the inclusion of an additional choice will be timely.

### Overview

[SQL Saturday Baton Rouge, LA](https://sqlsaturday.com/2022-08-06-sqlsaturday1026/) is an annual developer-focused event which hosts talks and presentations on various .NET, SQL, and other technical topics.

### Target Audience

The audience for SQL Saturday Guidebook are developers, database administrators, and other information technology workers such as designers, projects managers, business analysts, and other I.T. employees. Dark mode was chosen for the theme from an ad-hoc survey of would-be attendees. Many developers seem to prefer the dark mode of Visual Studio. A light mode is planned to be incorporated as a choice for subsequent years.

### Initial Design Concepts

The initial design concepts were sketched on the fly in one of the initial planning meetings for the event. Using an _ad hoc_ competitive analysis of other event guide apps, the event advisory board — myself included — generated the requirements on the spot.

### Key Challenges

The app is designed to be easily developed using Xamarin and many pre-defined layouts within Xamarin. Using pre-defined layouts enabled us to produce the app more quickly for both iOS and Android phones. Additionally, the design for the app had to be complete within a week. We relied on Lean UX and Genius Design in lieu of user research.

### Conclusion

As dark modes are all the rage among developer IDEs, I designed the app with dark mode only (which helped my short turn around time). For the next year I will add a light mode to the app. The annual event is including more management types, so the inclusion of an additional choice will be timely.
