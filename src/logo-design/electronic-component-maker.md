### About the Client

Bits is a small electronics manufacturing shop making parts for hobbyists and businesses.

### Design Inspiration

The Bits symbol is a fusion of existing electronics patterns and comic book symbolism. It is both Thorâ€™s hammer and a place where power contact is made. Notice the tiny lightning in it. It had to be simple enough to hold together at tiny sizes when printed on their branded circuit boards.
