### About the Client

EcoLogos wants to help businesses become better environmental stewards. Founder Tara Mundi wants to show businesses that just as we must use our economic resources wisely, so we must use our environmental resources wisely too. Something responsibly used and cared for will continue to provide dividends. If we care for the environment, we can use it more. Their name is a play on conversations and dialogue.

### Design Inspiration

Because of the play of words on their name and the environment, I decided to use a simple sphere with continents as interacting philosophies. This indicated the interplay between responsible use and stewardship. The continents are also outlined with green for continued growth.  The type is a mix of traditional and modern to further emphasize the philosophical interplays.
