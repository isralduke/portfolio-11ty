### About the Client

The Pelican Group is an organization which helps political entities to recognize unseen factors affected by their proposed policies.

### Design Inspiration

The Pelican Group is named for the Louisiana state bird. The pelican characters are executed in Art Deco-esque and minimal  style. Art Deco is the predominant style for Louisiana government buildings so it is a great starting point for political-leaning organizations.

The colors are less-saturated navy blue as it matches the primary color for Louisiana government with green and yellow for their association to Mardi Gras, warm weather, and agriculture.
