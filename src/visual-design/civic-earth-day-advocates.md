## About the Client

Earth Day Baton Rouge is an organization dedicated to arranging Earth Day celebrations in Louisiana. They began in Baton Rouge and would branch out to other cities in Louisiana.

## Design Inspiration

The pelican is the state bird of Louisiana so I presented the pelican as a leaf over a body of blue water. The city name would be presented in yellow, the local bright spot for their activities. The tagline “Educate, Celebrate” is presented in green to signify the topic of the celebration and education.
