### About the Client

Roux Wine & Spirits is a premium drinks retailer. Along with quality selections they offer tasting events and wine education.

### Informed Design Decisions

Named for the owners’ surname, the logo indicates their business type by the stemless wine glass in the “u” of the owners’ surname. The glass is neither full nor empty to present the idea that there is plenty, so enjoy the selections. The colors are red-violet and warm grey to signal wine and the premium level of the merchandise.
