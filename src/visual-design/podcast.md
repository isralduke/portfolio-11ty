### About the Client

The podcast A B.S. in Education is performed and produced by two teachers, Mrs. W. and Mrs. E. They have known each other for over 15 years and have worked in the field of education almost as long. Each week they have honest conversations about what’s going on in their lives and their classrooms.

### Design Inspiration

Their audience is their own peers, teachers from elementary, high school, art, and drama teachers. I used primary colors for their association to education and because primary colors are easier for our eyes to process. The logo mark is an apple, a microphone, a happy face, and two chat balloons. Additionally, the apple is excited because the podcast is performed by two extroverts.
