### About the Client

Dazifarm Designs is a custom jeweler. Their brand name is a remix of the phonetic spelling of their family name.

### Design Inspiration

The Persian art across history and the typeforms featured in the artwork in the client’s office informs the logo mark. In fact, much of that influence comes from the client’s own father’s handwriting. The blue and gold are taken directly from classic artworks featured in the Louvre and British Museum.
