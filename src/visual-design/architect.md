### About the Client
Alfred Roper Construction is the collaboration between Alfred and Sherry Roper, a husband and wife team. As they are an architect and interior designer duo, they present a full array of capabilities for their clients. This project came into my hands through a partnership with [Zwolle Consulting Services](https://zwolleconsultingservices.com).

### Design Inspiration
The Alfred Roper team wanted a super minimal, form-first logo to indicate their expertise. I used the ideas of weight and light and presented them as co-supporting forms which also included the typographic forms of Alfred Roper’s monogram. It’s an “A” and a “r” and a roof and a corner of a house. It represents their team-produced product.
