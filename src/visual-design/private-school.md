### About the Client

St. Luke’s Episcopal School is a small, tightly-knit, private school attached to St. Luke’s Episcopal Church. Seeking to become a recognized, separate organization, the school needed  a new brand for themselves.

### Informed Design Decisions

The logo is informed by the traditional Episcopal flag, in the colors and the graphic devices, such as the quatrafoil cross.

The logo sprouts from the Episcopal tradition but isn’t limited to it, but rather grows from it. Further, the negative space around the burgundy center creates an _ichthys_, or the legacy Christian fish. The typefaces evoke modernity with a strong educational history.
