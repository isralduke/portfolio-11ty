### About the Client

The Slow Polks is a family-owned and operated marathon management agency. They organize, produce, and handle all of the details for any organization which wants to produce a marathon for fund raising or awareness.

### Design Inspiration

The name, The Slow Polks, is a play on their last name, “Polk.” The logo needed to be simple enough for small stickers, but feature the entire business name while communicating what they do. A tennis shoe was the perfect solution. Their business cards didn’t list titles, only names, to stay in stride with the familial nature of their business.
