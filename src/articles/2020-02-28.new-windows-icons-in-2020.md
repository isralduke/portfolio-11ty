<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Microsoft is redesigning Windows’ new icons. This redesign will bring the icons inline with emerging brand standards of Windows and other Microsoft products. It will also bring rarely-seen icons up-to-date too.
</p>
<h4>The Analysis</h4>
<p>Microsoft’s design lead for Windows and Surface, Christina Koehn
, writes 
	<a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/iconic-icons-designing-the-world-of-windows-5e70e25e5416" target="_blank" title="Read Christina Koehns icon design walk though.">a walk-through of their design thinking and process</a>.
</p>
<p>She writes that a major challenge to the redesign is also a major factor for the redesign: creating harmonious brand and user experiences across a myriad of operating systems and devices. With iOS, Android, Windows, and MacOS versions of their apps, including web only versions, dictates a stronger need for consistency than ever before.
