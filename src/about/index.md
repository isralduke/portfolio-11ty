### Introduction

**I am a Google, Adobe, and W3C certified UX Designer**. I have about a decade of experience doing User Experience, User Interface, and Interaction Design in software. My experience ranges from small agencies to .NET shops to enterprise-sized teams. My career objective is to be an Interactive Designer, creating awesome, accessible, user-centered experiences for apps and websites.

### What I Do

I am a designer who can do some coding. My background and initial education is in graphic design, but I taught myself HTML and SCSS/CSS. This means I can make websites and have meaningful production discussions with frontend developers as I focus on the users’ needs. But let me clarify, I am not a frontend developer or any other kind of developer. I am a designer who can do some frontend coding using CSS frameworks. To illustrate, here’s the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1080971993134221445/Pelican-Mockups-1" target="_blank">Figma Community file</a> and <a href="https://pelican.ots.la.gov/" target="_blank">documentation site</a> for Pelican, a design I am building for Louisiana’s state government.

### Accessibility is Important

With <a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/42dc6997e0c4460f885d0763411dee0c" target="_blank">my W3C-certified knowledge</a> of semantic markup and accessibility, I can meaningfully contribute to creating accessible experiences for all users.

### Personal

In my free time, when I am not doing grad school work, I like to draw, read, and ride my bike with my wife, get coffee with friends, and enjoy warm weather.
