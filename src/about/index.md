### What I Do

I am a full stack designer. This means I do Interaction Design, User Interface Design, User Experience Design, and User Research. As a plus, I can even do some coding. (But I am not a frontend developer.) This means I can have meaningful production discussions to bridge the gap with frontend developers while I focus on the users’ needs.

### Accessibility is Important

It’s immoral to lock out users. It’s also bad business to deflate your potential customer base. My <a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/42dc6997e0c4460f885d0763411dee0c" target="_blank">W3C certification</a> for semantic markup and accessibility empowers me to meaningfully contribute to team efforts. At any stage of planning and design, from research to information architecture to development, I can contribute to a meaningful, accessible experience. 

### Personal

In my free time, when I am not doing grad school work, I like to draw, read, and ride my bike with my wife, get coffee with friends, and enjoy warm weather.
