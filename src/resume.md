## Objective

I want to design inclusive experiences which everyone can enjoy and benefit from.

My journey to making digital experiences which are usable by all began by teaching users and clients how to use experiences I helped produce. I noticed that some interface patterns were more quickly understood than others. I also learned that some people face barriers which I can’t imagine. The more I examined this, I learned that accessibility is vital to people who face barriers I can’t imagine.
