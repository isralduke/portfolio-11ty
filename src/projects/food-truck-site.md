### Project Role & Goal

During the BzzTruck responsive website project I acted as the UX Designer and Visual Designer. BzzTruck’s goal was to create a new, responsive website so customers can engage with it. The website allows visitors to see the BzzTruck’s location on the current day and the next day. It also allows customer to pay ahead for contactless payments.

### Target Audience

BzzTruck’s audience is primarily onsite employees and workers in the cities where it has a presence. These are mostly office workers in a variety of sectors. The target audience is familiar and comfortable with mobile ordering.

### Key Challenges

The key challenge was to condense the client’s desired features and market-standard features into a singe page website. This decision reduced the information architecture and navigation to bare minimum which tested well among participants.

### Research

Remote interviews uncovered popular food trucks in the regions where the participants lived. These participants also took part in the usability studies remotely, via teleconferencing and screen sharing.

### Digital Wireframes

### Usability Testing

Usability testing data was recorded in a spreadsheet for each of the participants. Each participant was asked to perform key tasks in the wireframes. Moderated, remote testing enabled us to answer questions about the function about the testing apparatus verses the actual wireframe design.

### Conclusion

Depending on BzzTruck’s business success, a mobile application will designed which will feature notifications in conjunction with order ahead and proximity sensing.
