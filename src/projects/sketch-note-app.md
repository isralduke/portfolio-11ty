title: Sketch Note App

### Overview

Squiddle is a free, note-creating iOS app inspired by sticky notes. Squiddle notes have a square format, just like physical sticky notes. The user interface isn’t hidden but the “power user” gets features like tagging and alarms.

### Target Audience

The user for Squiddle likes to scribble notes because they’re easier to make and it feels more natural than starting a text editing experience. The act of scribbling a note is a natural, more organic experience.

### Initial Design Concepts

We started with real pencil and paper to immerse ourselves in the organic feel we wanted to preserve for the user. Squares are the shape of sticky notes and squares are simple, basic shapes, so we decided to stick to simple shapes for the user interface and icons as well.
