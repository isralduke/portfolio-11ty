### About the Client

Roux Luxury Travel is a premium travel agency which creates custom travel packages. They manage and coordinate all aspects of their clientsâ€™ travel experiences.

### Design Inspiration

The logo uses the commonly-recognized symbols such as the map pin and heart. This indicates they will bring their clients where the love to go and that they will enjoy the service. The line under the map pin states a solid, reliable level of customer service.

The colors are red as passion for travel, yellow as optimism, and a warm grey as the reliable, solid service behind the scenes.
