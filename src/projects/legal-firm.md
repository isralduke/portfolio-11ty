### About the Client

[Progeny Law Firm](https://progenylawfirm.com) is an estate law firm which works closely with its clients to learn their needs.

### Design Inspiration

Progeny Law Firm wanted a warm and approachable, yet professional feel in their logo. It says “law firm” with the antiquities-inspired column cap yet it’s presented simply to work at small, social media sizes. The typeface, Goudy Old Style, signals a professional legal practice. The colors are warm, friendly, and calm at the same time.
