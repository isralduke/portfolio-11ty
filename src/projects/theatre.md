### About the Client

[Rozzie Square Theatre](http://www.rozziesquaretheater.com) is a theatre in Boston which hosts live comedy and improv classes.

### Design Inspiration

Rozzie Square Theatre is named for the square performing space which makes it unique. I took design inspiration from the square and from the groan-inducing situation where someone tall sits in front of you in the theatre. We chose the colors purple and black for their rich qualities, but not bright luminescence. You don’t want distractions from the performance while you’re enjoying it.
