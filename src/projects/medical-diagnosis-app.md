### Overview

Relief Telemed created a mobile application and web application for healthcare professionals to remotely diagnose patients. This covers the web application used by the healthcare professionals.

### Target Audience

The user for this web application is an educated, trained, and licensed registered nurse. This is the highest rank of nurse and they are legally sanctioned for diagnosing patients and writing limited prescriptions.

### Key Challenges

This web application needs to fit and work on small laptops to ensure maximum hardware compatibility. The video is fixed in place so the healthcare professional can always have the patient in view while scrolling the chart. Controls are designed to be large enough for easy, non-precise clicking. The color choices are limited to reserve high-intensity colors for important status, system, or patient-related info to gain prominence. As much as possible, we limited the layouts of the portal to be two columns, but no more than three if absolutely necessary, to control information density for easy scanning and reading. The UX designer role was mostly distributed across the product owner and a SME.

### Digital Wireframes

The wireframes were collaboratively designed with the CIO and CEO, using their backgrounds in medicine and informatics, to guide the placement of “widget regions”. As the digital wireframes were simple rectangles denoting widget regions, we iteratively arranged the regions until the executive team was satisfied.
