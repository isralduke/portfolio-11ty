### About the Client

Zia Moving Company is a small moving company in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

### Design Inspiration

The logo mark is adapted from the [zia symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_New_Mexico) on the New Mexico flag. The real “zia” symbol has just four leading lines coming from the central circle but this one has five. The five leading lines symbolize the fingers on the movers’ hands who help the movers.
