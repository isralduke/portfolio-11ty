title: Digital Driver’s License App
---

### Project Role & Goal

During the La Wallet app project I was the UX Designer, the Stakeholder Interviewer, and the Icon Designer. La Wallet’s purpose is to allow Louisiana drivers to keep and use their driver’s license in their phones. The Louisiana Legislature enacted a law enabling drivers’ licenses to be digital.

### Target Audience

There are two primary users for the digital driver’s license: the driver and the public safety officer who needs to see the driver’s license.

### Key Challenges

The driver needs fast, a fews taps as possible access to present their license to the safety offices. The safety officer needs to easily see or scan the license code without touching or holding the driver’s phone. The design and development team even incorporated a dark mode into the app before iOS officially supported dark mode.

### Conclusion

The digital driver’s license is called La Wallet. It’s designed, developed, and owned by Envoc, a software agency in Louisiana, where I worked on La Wallet as the UX Designer while I was an employee.
