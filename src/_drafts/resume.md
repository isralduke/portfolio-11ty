## Objective

**I want to design inclusive products which benefit everyone.**

My journey to making human products began as I trained people to use the products I designed. Some things stood out to me: some design patterns were easier to understand than others, and some people had difficulties which others did not face. This led me to discover the user experience side of product design. Along the way I learned to consider accessibility because some people encounter obstacles that I don’t. As I product designer I need to consider the organization’s needs and goals while respecting the user’s needs and goals.
