### About the Client

Crossroads Community Church is an assembly of readers who strive for a correct understanding of the bible before drawing conclusions about their beliefs. They think that as a church they themselves are not important, that the real importance is Jesus Christ’s resurrection after his death on the cross.

### Design Inspiration

There are two intersecting roads in the symbol to represent the “crossroads” part of their name. The tapered, red object represents a direction of travel, perceived as “up” in western reading direction, and it’s also a thorn and a nail.
