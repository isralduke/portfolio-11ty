<h4>Color is Important</h4>
<p>We need to see and detect color because it’s a major way that we visually sense our surroundings. We can see because of the rods and cones in our eyes. Light entering the eye strikes those rods and cones and they convert the light into sensory information for the brain. The rods enable us to see light and dark. The cones enable us to see color. Did you know that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10848/" target="_blank">our eyes have approximately 5,000,000 color-seeing cones</a>?
</p>
<h4>Colors signal the brand</h4>
<p>One way we know the brand of the digital products we’re using is because of color. Whether it’s the color in the brand’s visual identity or the colors related to the brand’s product, it’s one of the primary ways we know the brand which owns the digital product we’re using.
</p>
<h4>Colors are interface cues</h4>
<p>Depending on the colors in the brand, some adjustments may be necessary<span class="redactor-invisible-space">. If the brand is using red as their main color, then any red used in interface cues will need to be adjusted for distinction. So if Company A uses a dark red as their main color, it’s a good idea to use a brighter, more vivid red for interface cues.<br></span>

</p>
<h4>Colors need contrast</h4>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space">Further, colors chosen to work in the interface should conform to <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/" target="_blank">WCAG color contrast guidelines</a>. As an example, this means we won’t be choosing to present small, yellow text on a white background. Wherever text is placed, it’s nice to have a 7:1 color contrast ratio, a contrast ratio higher of 4.5:1 or higher is necessary.</span>

</p>
<h4>Color doesn’t work alone<br></h4>
<p>Our eyes quickly recognize colors. For people without vision deficiencies or color blindness, color is an excellent interface signal. But for people with vision deficiencies or color blindness, we have to add additional visual cues such as shape, texture, other cues such as borders or shadows, and possibly even size.

</p>
<p>In the example above, you’ll notice the icons which help describe the buttons’ actions. Also take note how the “Delete” button has a diagonally-striped texture. Because the other buttons don’t have textures, the “Delete” button has extra cues warning the user about the “Delete” button.
</p>
<h4>Color is situational, not arbitrary</h4>
<p>Color shouldn’t chosen arbitrarily. Choosing colors is by large guided by external factors such as contrast guidelines and brand considerations. Your team’s designer will think about the factors above but they will also use what they learn about the users and the stakeholders to choose the best colors for the interface.
