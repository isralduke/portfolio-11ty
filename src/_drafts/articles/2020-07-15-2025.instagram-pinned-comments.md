<p>Instagram is one of the most popular social media networks and its mobile app is used all over the world. With such a wide distribution of users and installations on innumerable phones, it’s sure to attract users who will not bring their good manners.

<h4>Promoting Positive Conversation</h4>
<p>A free society is one that can engage in debate and compare ideas. Free speech is the ability to engage in debate and hold one’s own views. Unfortunately, not everyone respects the requirement of mutual respect in online conversation. Whether a user strongly objects to a view presented or has forgotten their polite behavior, users are free to say whatever they wish. Yet, I am sure no one really wants to talk to a rude person, in real life or online.

<h4>The Balance in User Choices</h4>
<p>Instagram seems to strike a good balance between free speech and a <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-our-work-to-fight-online-bullying" target="_blank">user’s control of their own profile</a>. Instagram could either shadow ban or completely ban flagged users. This move to pin comments allows users their freedom to be rude but also allows the recipients of rude speech to indicate the tone of voice they’re willing to hear. Freedom of speech does not imply the obligation for others to listen.
