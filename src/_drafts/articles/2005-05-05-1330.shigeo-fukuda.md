<h4>Artist</h4>
<p>Shigeo Fukuda uses type that acts according to the concept of the piece. The type behaves in its own manner, not necessarily interacting with the graphics. The type and the mark each behave in a manner reflecting the concept of the piece. The type and the graphics are each individually working out in a unique fashion, separate from the other, but unified in a common philosophy, the principal behind the work.

<h4>Cultural Conext</h4>
<p>It seems to me that much American design seems fixated on making the type visually “fit” into the graphic. To Americans, the graphic is the important piece.
</p>
<p>I wonder if this preoccupation is because of America’s history of being a “melting pot.” With so many languages circulating the country, particularly New York, the practice of iconography — present as the graphic portion of a work — might be an effective way to ensure cross-cultural communications.
