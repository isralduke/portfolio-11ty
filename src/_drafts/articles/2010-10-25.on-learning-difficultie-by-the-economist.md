<h4>What I Learned</h4>
<p>It’s long been the consensus among designers and advertising people that an easy-to-read ad is more effective. We were taught by our professors and mentors that we should never detract from the legibility of the message. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17248892?story_id=17248892&fsrc=rss" target="_blank">A recent article by The Economist</a> cites material that challenges this commonly-held maxim.
</p>
<h4>New Information</h4>
<!--more-->
<p>Studies by Princeton University psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer used 28 volunteers, aged 18 to 40, to review material about fictional alien species and then tested them on the material presented. Those who read the material in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodoni">Bodoni</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_sans">Comic Sans</a>, harder to read fonts than the control font <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial">Arial</a>, retained more of the material. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17248892?story_id=17248892&fsrc=rss">You can read the article by The Economist</a> to learn more in-depth information about the types of material asked of the volunteers. (Why didn't they use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica">Helvetica</a> instead of Arial?)
</p>
<h4>Design Questions</h4>
<p>This raises some questions for me because as a designer my primary mission is to make knowledge more accessible through visual means such as color, form, visual rhythm, and, of course, typeface.
</p>
<p>Does this mean I can broaden my typeface selection to include those that aren’t supposedly modern? Or, does it mean that I now need to consider long term retention and short term benefit?
</p>
<p>A puff piece might be modern, but the harder to read typeface might be better for information committed to longer term memory storage.

<h4>Flexibility!</h4>
<p>The immediate upshot that comes to my mind is that now designers would have even greater flexibility in choosing typefaces and fonts for their projects. The spirit of the letters would be released to an ever greater freedom for making impressions upon the designer for the message's final visual manifestation.
</p>
<h4>The Warning</h4>
<p>Of course, now the designers can have more fun in the projects or face greater challenges in arguing against the clients’ use of horrible fonts such as Arial, Papyrus, or Comic Sans.
